  "content": "The best way i can describe code to a new beginner is 'English and symbols', or better 'Questions and Actions'. Code is more simple for eaiser languages than you would think. Things like, JavaScript, Python, Lua, C#, All are essentially the same when boiled down. what im trying to say is that simpler languages are alot eaiser than you would think. its a matter of getting it to click, and at first you might have to pick at others code to learn. Thats okay as long as you dont directly steal it."
